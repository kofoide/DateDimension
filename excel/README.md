# Date Dimension in Excel

The DatesSmall.xlsx file contains a single row for each date. This file begins with 1/1/2018 and ends with 12/31/2023.

Each row has computed columns that represent some sort of date math information about the date.

Many of the columns are pretty straightforward and seemingly obvious.

Some are not so obvious.

A dictionary is included in the xlsx doc that explains each column.

An example Tableau workbook is also included that references Superstore and the Dates worksheet in the xlsx file.

A relationship between Superstore.OrderDate & Dates.ThisDate has already been setup.
